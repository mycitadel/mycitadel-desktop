# MyCitadel Desktop

## Bitcoin, Lightning and RGB wallet

![Banner](data/banner.jpg)

MyCitadel is a wallet for **bitcoin, digital assets and bitcoin finance 
(#BiFi) smart contracts**. It is blazingly fast, secure, cross-platform and 
technically most advanced wallet on the market, being the first wallet 
allowing taproot multisig and locktime-based spending conditions.

Do a reliable hodling (with inheritance options), corporate/organization, & 
current accounts - or instant Lightning payments. Work with single- and 
multisig setups, based on hardware, air gapped, cold and server-side hot key 
storage, involving arbitrary complex time-lock scripts (with miniscript) and
wide interoperability (because of use of wallet descriptors).
